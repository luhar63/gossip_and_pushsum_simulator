# Gossip-PushSum

A simulator in Elixir for these communication algorithms for aggregating Information: Gossip and Push-sum. The goal of the simulator is to determine the convergence time and ratio for a given number of nodes, and judge the performance for the different topologies. The simulator can run following topologies: 2D Grid, 3D Torus Grid, Honeycomb, Full, Line. Also provided is the simulation and testing of node failure conditions.

Implementation is done as described in this publication: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/johannes/papers/2003/focs2003-gossip.pdf

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `gossip` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:gossip, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
